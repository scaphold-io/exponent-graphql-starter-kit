# hello-graphql

- An example project that integrates Exponent with [Apollo
Client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client) to interact with a
[Scaphold](https://scaphold.io/) backend.

- Try it here: https://getexponent.com/@vning93/hello-graphql


## Running it locally

Clone this repo and `npm install` and open it with XDE or exp.

If you want to use your own Scaphold account, first sign up on
[Scaphold.io](https://scaphold.io/), then create a database.
Next, swap out the `networkInterface` `uri` in `main.js` with
the uri of your fancyÂ new database ([find your uri on the Scaphold
apps page](https://scaphold.io/apps)).
